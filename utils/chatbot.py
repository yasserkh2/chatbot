    ###EXAMPLES OF BAD CONTRACTS
    Bad contract

    Clause 1: The seller undertakes to sell the item to the buyer for the price.

    Clause 2: The item sold will be delivered to the buyer on the delivery date.

    Clause 3: The Buyer pays the price to the Seller on the payment date.

    This contract is bad because:

    It does not clearly specify the seller or price.
    No delivery date or payment date is specified.
    It does not specify any warranties to the buyer.
    Another bad decade

    Clause 1: The seller undertakes to sell the item to the buyer for the price.

    Clause 2: The item sold will be delivered to the buyer within 30 days from the date of the contract.

    Clause 3: The buyer pays the price to the seller within 30 days from the delivery date.

    Clause 4: The seller has the right to cancel the contract if the buyer does not pay the price on time.

    This contract is bad because:

    It gives the seller the right to cancel the contract if the buyer does not pay the price on time, even if there is no reason for this.
    The Buyer gives no warranties if the Seller does not deliver the item on time.
    Third bad decade

    Clause 1: The seller undertakes to sell the item to the buyer for the price.

    Clause 2: The item sold will be delivered to the buyer within 30 days from the date of the contract.

    Clause 3: The buyer pays the price to the seller within 30 days from the delivery date.

    Clause 4: The Seller has the right to modify any of the terms of the contract at any time without notice.

    This contract is bad because:

    It gives the seller the right to modify any of the terms of the contract at any time, which may harm the buyer.
    The buyer does not give any guarantees if the seller modifies the contract.
    How to verify the contract

    Before signing any contract, it is important to read it carefully and check the following:

    Does the contract clearly define what is being sold or bought?
    Does the contract clearly define the terms of payment and delivery?
    Does the contract include any guarantees for the buyer?
    Does the contract give any rights to the seller that could harm the buyer?
    ###some advices
    * **A contract that contains unclear or ambiguous terms.** For example, the contract may state that the seller “undertakes to use his best efforts to deliver the merchandise on time.” What does "do your best" mean? Does this mean that the seller will do his best even if it means losing money?
    * **A contract that gives one party an unfair advantage over the other party.** For example, a contract may state that the seller has the right to terminate the contract at any time without notice. This gives the seller absolute power and leaves the buyer in a weak position.
    * **A contract that does not include any guarantees to the buyer.** For example, a contract may state that the buyer bears all risks related to the sale. This means that the buyer will be responsible for any defects or problems with the item sold.

    Here are some specific examples of contract terms that could be considered bad:

    * **Conditions that allow the seller to change the terms after signing the contract.**
    * **Conditions that give the seller the right to cancel the contract without notice.**
    * **Terms that allow the seller to void certain warranties.**
    * **Terms that allow the seller to charge the buyer unexpected fees.**
    * **Conditions that make it difficult or impossible for the buyer to terminate the contract.**

    If you think a contract may be bad, it is best to consult an attorney. An attorney can help you understand the contract and identify any terms that may be unfair or harmful.

    Here are some tips to prevent signing a bad contract:

    * **Read the contract carefully before signing it.**
    * **Have an attorney review the contract.**
    * **Ask to discuss any unclear or ambiguous terms with the seller.**
    * **Don't feel pressured to sign a contract if you're not comfortable with it.**
