    "    How to verify the contract\n",
    "\n",
    "    Before signing any contract, it is important to read it carefully and check the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "    Does the contract clearly define what is being sold or bought?\n",
    "    Does the contract clearly define the terms of payment and delivery?\n",
    "    Does the contract include any guarantees for the buyer?\n",
    "    Does the contract give any rights to the seller that could harm the buyer?\n",
    "    ###some advices\n",
    "    * **A contract that contains unclear or ambiguous terms.** For example, the contract may state that the seller “undertakes to use his best efforts to deliver the merchandise on time.” What does \"do your best\" mean? Does this mean that the seller will do his best even if it means losing money?\n",
    "    * **A contract that gives one party an unfair advantage over the other party.** For example, a contract may state that the seller has the right to terminate the contract at any time without notice. This gives the seller absolute power and leaves the buyer in a weak position.\n",
    "    * **A contract that does not include any guarantees to the buyer.** For example, a contract may state that the buyer bears all risks related to the sale. This means that the buyer will be responsible for any defects or problems with the item sold.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Here are some specific examples of contract terms that could be considered bad:\n",
    "\n",
    "    * **Conditions that allow the seller to change the terms after signing the contract.**\n",
    "    * **Conditions that give the seller the right to cancel the contract without notice.**\n",
    "    * **Terms that allow the seller to void certain warranties.**\n",
    "    * **Terms that allow the seller to charge the buyer unexpected fees.**\n",
    "    * **Conditions that make it difficult or impossible for the buyer to terminate the contract.**\n",
    "\n",
    "    If you think a contract may be bad, it is best to consult an attorney. An attorney can help you understand the contract and identify any terms that may be unfair or harmful.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Here are some tips to prevent signing a bad contract:\n",
    "\n",
    "    * **Read the contract carefully before signing it.**\n",
    "    * **Have an attorney review the contract.**\n",
    "    * **Ask to discuss any unclear or ambiguous terms with the seller.**\n",
    "    * **Don't feel pressured to sign a contract if you're not comfortable with it.**\n",
